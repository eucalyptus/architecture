= Overview =
Feature consists of fundamental Autoscaling support implementing the AWS defined API.  There are two primary use cases:
# Manual auto-scaling
# Action triggered auto-scaling based on custom metrics
Other important characteristics which are essential in serving these use cases are:
# Register/Deregister instances with ELB
== Types of Scaling ==
For 3.3 we only consider two kinds of scaling:
# ''' Manual''' : user controlled change to sizing of autoscaling group.
## [[SetDesiredCapacity]] allows the user to explicitly set the group size.
## [[ExecutePolicy]] allows the user to trigger the application of a scaling policy by hand.
# ''' Alarm/Policy'''  based: user configures metric-based actions which trigger application of a scaling policy.
## [[MetricAlarms]] configured using [[PutMetricAlarm]] act as triggers.
## [[AlarmActions]] reference the [[ScalingPolcicy]] relative to the fully qualified [[AutoScalingGroupARN]].
# ''' Second for 3.3''' 
## Metric collection
## Scaling process control
# ''' Excluded from 3.3''' 
## Notifications
## Operations requiring VPC support
## Anything requiring support for spot instances
## Schedule based scaling is not part of the 3.3 implementation plan.
## Operations needed for schedule based scaling must still be present and Describe operations must successfully return an empty response.  This is needed to avoid breaking client tools.

* Required operations in topological order
** Operations for definiton a group
*** <code>{Create,Describe,Update,Delete}AutoScalingGroup</code>

== Launch Configuration ==
* Describes how to add instances  instances
** AMI 
** Instance Type
** Security Group
** Instance Key Pair
* Only one active launch configuration at a time
* Auto Scaling will terminate instances with old launch configurations first
** Rolling software updates

== Auto Scaling Group == 
Auto Scaling managed grouping of EC2 instances
Automatic health check to maintain pool size
Automatically scale the number of instances by policy 
Min, Max, Desired
Automatic Integration with ELB
Automatic Integration with AZs
Automatic distribution & balancing across AZs

== Auto Scaling Policy == 
Parameters for performing an Auto Scaling action
Scale Up/Down
By how much
ChangeInCapacity (+/- #) 
ExactCapacity (#) 
ChangeInPercent (+/- %) 
Cool Down (seconds)
Policy can be triggered by CloudWatch Events

== Cloud Watch Alarms ==
Monitors a CloudWatch metric 
Threshold (> 50% CPU)
Period (for 3 minutes)
Alarm States
OK - Within defined threshold
ALARM - Outside defined threshold
INSUFFICIENT_DATA - Metric does not have enough data to determine state
Available Actions
Trigger Auto Scaling Policy (scale up/down event) 
Send SNS notification

== Scaling Activity == 
Instance Launch
Instances are launched (not started) from a “gold” image
 Bootstrapping is important! 
 Automatically added to ELB (if configured) 
Instance Termination
Instances are terminated (not stopped)
 Longest running instance from the oldest launch config first 
 Automatically removed from ELB (if configured) 
Cooldown
The period after an Auto Scaling activity during which no other scaling activity can take place
Gives the system time to perform and adjust to before executing a new scaling activity
300 seconds (5 minutes) by default
Suspend/Resume Processes
Allows you to manually suspend and resume Auto Scaling activities
