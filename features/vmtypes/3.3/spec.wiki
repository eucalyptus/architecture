VM Type support in Eucalyptus has two disjoint aspects:

# AWS compatibility as determined by published VM type names (but not necessarily characteristics).
# Private cloud administrator control over vm type definitions.



== AWS compatibility ==
Currently (09/18/12) the [[http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/|vm type definitions used by AWS]] are:
{|
! Micro 
| t1.micro 
|-
! Standard 
| m1.small 
| m1.medium 
| m1.large 
| m1.xlarge 
|-
! High CPU 
| c1.medium 
| c1.xlarge 
|- 
! High Mem 
| m2.xlarge 
| m2.2xlarge 
| m2.4xlarge 
|- 
! Cluster Compute 
| cc1.4xlarge 
| cc2.8xlarge
|-
! High I/O 
| hi1.4xlarge 
|-
! GPU 
| cg1.4xlarge 
|}

== Notes ==
* MVP is a larger number of vm types
** Having an arbitrary number is not in MVP
** Create and Delete become optional if the number of VMTypes are fixed
* MVP precludes requiring admin to login via to adjust the VMTypes
* MVP includes an admin API for controlling vm type definitions
** Create and Delete are optional
** Don't allow for removal of default AWS types
* Deleting would involve invalidating existing references
* t1.micro doesn't have instance store option
* MVP includes a euca-describe-vmtypes
* Ephemeral disk configurations
* UserConsole changes related to removing config file for vmtypes
** Use the new UI instead
** Change the presentation to accommodate the larger number of vmtypes
** Changing ephemeral configuration changes the 
* Admin UI 
** Presentation of existing types
** Create and delete mutable types
* Authorization and authentication are required in 
* Constraints on legitimate values
* Restrict naming to [:alnum:] period
