= Trinity Use Case =
Briefly, the use case is:
# A horizontally scalable app whose instances are managed as an autoscaling group (ASG)
# The ASG registers its instances w/ an ELB
# The ELB produces metrics that are available through CloudWatch
# The ELB metrics are used to compute a custom metric which factors in other values, too.
# The custom metric is put back into CloudWatch
# The custom metric is used to drive a CloudWatch alarm
# The CloudWatch alarm action triggers the execution of the ASG's scaling policy.

== Autoscaling ==
* Define an Autoscaling group
* ASG definition identifies related load balancer
* ASG can use ELB health check type
* ASG scaling policies invokable through ExecutePolicy

== CloudWatch ==
* PutMetricData can be used to submit custom metric
* GetMetricStatistics can be used on system and custom metrics
* Alarms can be defined
* Alarm actions are working

== ELB ==
* Registering instances is possible
* Gathers AWS defined metrics for load balancers

== Service Interactions ==
* '''Autoscaling -> ELB:''' ASG registers member instances with ELB
* '''ELB -> CW:''' AWS defined system metrics are submitted to CW
* '''User -> CW:''' Can compute statistics on system metrics
* '''User -> CW:''' Can submit custom metrics
* '''CW -> Autoscaling:''' CW alarm action triggers scaling policy execution for autoscaling group
