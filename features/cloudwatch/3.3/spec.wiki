== Metrics / ListMetrics & PutMetricData ==
* Represents a time-ordered set of data points. 
* '''Metrics''' are uniquely defined by:
** Name
** Namespace
** One or more dimensions 
** Each data point has a time stamp
** And (optionally) a unit of measure 
* When you request '''statistics''', the returned data stream is identified by:
** Namespace
** Metric name
** Dimension
** And (optionally) the unit
* PutMetricData can be used to create a custom metric and publish data points for it. 
** '''Data points''':
*** can be added in any order (i.e., ordering is determined by time)
*** can be added at any rate
*** that are fully identical (duplicate values, time stamps, and units) are aggregated at statistic computation time.
** The '''retention interval''' determines the duration of the history of any kind of data point is stored:  default two weeks of history. 
* Statistics are computed over a metric's data points during a given time window. 
* '''Namespaces''' names are strings defined when a metric is created 
** These names are constrainted to:
*** Valid XML characters
*** Fewer than 256 characters in length.
*** Typically containing the alphanumeric characters "0-9A-Za-z" plus "."(period), "-" (hyphen), "_" (underscore), "/" (slash), "#" (hash), and ":" (colon). 
** Pre-defined namespaces follow the convention AWS/<service>, such as AWS/and AWS/ELB.
** There is no default namespace (a namespace must be specified for each data element).
* '''Dimension''' is a name/value pair that helps you to uniquely identify a metric.
** Adding a unique dimension in effect creates a new metric.  They are not a separate entity -- they are an attribute.
** Internal services also attach dimensions to each metric.
** For internal metrics data points can be aggregated across dimensions.
** There is a limit on the number of dimensions for a metric: default ten.
** Each unique combination of dimensions is a separate metric. 
* '''Time stamps''' marks every metric data point.
** The time stamp must be within the retention interval defined above.
** The time stamp can be in the future by up to some time period: default one day.
** If not specified, a time stamp of the current time will be used when the data element is received.
** The time stamp is a dateTime object (complete date, plus hours, minutes, and seconds; http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime). 
* '''Units'''  represent the unit of measure. 
** A unit can be specified with custom metrics. 
** Data published without a unit uses the '''None''' unit.
** Statistics requested without specifying a unit result in data points which share the same unit being aggregated together according to the given statistic request.
*** Two metrics with different units will return a data stream for each unit separately.
  
== Statistics/GetMetricStatistics ==
* '''Statistics''' are metric data aggregations over specified periods of time. 
** Aggregations are made using:
*** Namespace
*** Metric name
*** Dimensions
*** Unit
*** Within a given time period. 
* Defined statistics for a specified period of time is:
** Minimum: The lowest value observed.
** Maximum: The highest value observed.
** Sum:  All values submitted for the matching metric added together.
** SampleCount: The count (number) of data points used for the statistical calculation.
** Average: The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified period.
* '''Time periods'''
** Each statistic represents an aggregation of the metrics data collected for a specified period of time. 
** A period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) or as long as two weeks (1,209,600 seconds).
** The minimum granularity for a period is one minute.
** You also specify the encompassing period, or start and end times that CloudWatch will use for the aggregation. 
** The starting and ending points can be as close together as 60 seconds, and as far apart as two weeks.
* When you call GetMetricStatistics, you can specify the period length with the Period parameter. Two related parameters, StartTime and EndTime, determine the overall length of time associated with the statistics. 
* The default value for the Period parameter is 60 seconds, whereas the default values for StartTime and EndTime give you the last hour's worth of statistics.
* The values you select for the StartTime and EndTime parameters determine how many periods GetMetricStatistics will return. 

Periods are also an important part of the CloudWatch Alarms feature. When you create an alarm to monitor a specific metric, you are asking CloudWatch to compare that metric to the threshold value that you supplied. You have extensive control over how CloudWatch makes that comparison. Not only can you specify the period over which the comparison is made, but you can also specify how many consecutive periods the threshold must be breached before you are notified. For more information on Alarms, see Alarms.

* '''Aggregation''' in PutMetricData allows for samples (sets of data points) to be submitted along w/ the corresponding metric.
** Data points can have the same or similar time stamps. 
*** Data points for a metric that share the same time stamp, namespace and dimensions will return aggregated statistics about those data points.
** Multiple data points in the same PutMetricData call with the same time stamp. 
** Multiple unrelated data points can also be published in one call.
** The size of a PutMetricData request is limited: 
*** default 8KB for HTTP GET
*** default 40KB for HTTP POST 
** PutMetricData request maximum data points per request: default of 20 data points.
** '''StatisticSets''' are pre-aggregated data sets: given the Min, Max, Sum, and SampleCount of a number of datapoints. 
  
== Alarms ==
* CloudWatch is especially useful because it helps you make decisions and take immediate, automatic actions based on your metric data. 
* Alarms can automatically initiate actions on your behalf, based on parameters you specify. 
* An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify, and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. 
* The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic or Auto Scaling policy. 
* Alarms invoke actions for sustained state changes only. 
* CloudWatch alarms will not invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state, the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods.

| '''Dimensions'''
|-
| Dimension
| Description
|-
| AutoScalingGroupName    
| This dimension filters the data you request for all instances in a specified capacity group. An AutoScalingGroup is a collection of instances you define if you're using the Auto Scaling service.

|-
| InstanceType    
| This dimension filters the data you request for all instances running with this specified instance type. This helps you categorize your data by the type of instance running. For example, you might compare data from an m1.small instance and an m1.large instance to determine which has the better business value for your application. Available for instances with Detailed Monitoring enabled.

|-
| VolumeReadOps/VolumeWriteOps
| The total number of operations in the period.
| Count
|-
| VolumeTotalReadTime/VolumeTotalWriteTime
| The total number of seconds spent by all operations that completed in the period. If multiple requests are submitted at the same time, this total could be greater than the length of the period.

| The total number of seconds in the period when no read or write operations were submitted.
| Seconds
|-
| VolumeQueueLength
| The number of read and write operation requests waiting to be completed in the period.
| Count
|-
| VolumeThroughputPercentage
| Used with Provisioned IOPS volumes only. The percentage of I/O operations per second (IOPS) delivered out of the IOPS provisioned for an EBS volume. Provisioned IOPS volumes deliver within 10 percent of the provisioned IOPS performance 99.9 percent of the time over a given year.
| Percent
| During a write, if there are no other pending I/O requests in a minute, the metric value will be 100 percent. Also, a volume's I/O performance may become degraded temporarily due to an action you have taken (e.g., creating a snapshot of a volume during peak usage, running the volume on a non-EBS-optimized instance, accessing data on the volume for the first time).
|-
| VolumeConsumedReadWriteOps
| Used with Provisioned IOPS volumes only. The total amount of read and write operations consumed in the period.
| Count
|-
| '''Dimensions'''
