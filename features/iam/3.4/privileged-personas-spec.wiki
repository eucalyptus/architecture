= New User Model =
* Eucalyptus should clearly differentiate between different privileged cloud personas (currently all accommodated by the ''eucalyptus'' account) and provide ways to compartmentalize their privileges
* Eucalyptus should be able to accommodate simple deployments where most of the below roles are played by 1 or 2 individuals
* Eucalyptus should provide the ability to define which roles are needed for a particular deployment AND what each of these roles are going to be able to do 

The eucalyptus account is currently used to perform a variety of privileged operations ranging from cloud setup to cross-account resource management. In the new user model, there is going to a single super privileged user that can do all functionality currently available to the ''eucalyptus'' account but be limited by local-host access only. This user can be used to perform privileged operations when needed using local-host access and can bootstrap other privileged accounts/users/roles that can be used remotely and delegate a customizable set of privileges (defined by policies) to them. 

== Privileged Personas ==
* the ''Cloud Super Admin'' (CSA)
** the super powerful user, which can perform any privileged operation in Eucalyptus and delegate these privileges
** should have limited access (local root only?)
** the only user who can create, modify and delete privileged policies and assign these policies to users
* the ''Cloud Resource Manager'' (CRM) 
** can manage AWS-defined resources (such as S3 objects, instances, users, etc) across accounts
** from PRD-37, typical responsibilities 
*** Management (accounts, cloud resources, policies, quotas, users, groups)
*** Monitoring (capacity, usage)
*** Reporting (usage reporting, account activity, audit trail)
*** Backup and Restore
* the ''Infrastructure Admin'' (IA)
** can perform operations related to system setup and management
** from PRD-37, typical responsibilities
*** installation and configuration
**** prepare environment
**** install Eucalyptus
**** configure Eucalyptus
*** Monitoring and Maintenance
**** Infrastructure supporting the cloud
**** Cloud management layer
**** Upgrades, security patches
**** Diagnostics and troubleshooting
*** Backup and Restore 

== Privileged Users and Roles ==
* Users
** CSA
* Roles
** CRM
*** a policy should allow for any supported AWS action (e.g., actions: "ec2:*", "s3:*", "iam:*", "elb:*", "as:*", "cw:*") + reporting
*** need a way to specify in a policy that cross-account access is allowed (e.g., by prepending a special namespace to all actions "euca:ec2:*" or by employing ARNs "arn:aws:service:region:*:resource") 
** IA
*** a policy should allow for the actions supported by Empyrean, Configuration, and Properties services)

== Requirements ==
* a user can assume more than one role (is there a limit?) 
* provide canned policies for privileged roles
* policy language should allow for specifying cross-account access

== Security Restrictions ==
* limited access to CSA functionality (local root only?)
* only CSA can
** define privileged policies
** define privileged policies to users and roles
** grant/revoke access to privileged roles
* accounts with privileged access should not have preset default password

== UX Requirements ==
* TBD

== Notes ==
* euca-modify-property should be separated into 2 operation: to modify properties (for IA) and to modify runtime (by default, for CSA only)
* how to distinguish between expired and invalid credentials?! (if valid, but expired, the error message can say that they are expired)
* lifetime of STS credentials for privileged roles
** should be short, allow for one operation only?
* role discovery by client tools and UI
** should only work for the privileged roles, but not any roles that an account is allowed to assume
* some operations typically performed by IA, also need to be available to other users and account admins should be able to delegate these privileges
** DescribeServices
** any others?
