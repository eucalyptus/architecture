= Networking =
	•	The next generation of networking must 
	–	preserve support for the existing AWS network semantics 
	–	accommodate expansion to other AWS semantics
	–	
	•	Pending AWS semantics
	–	Security Groups
	•	VM participation in multiple security groups (membership vs. firewall groups)
	–	VPC
	•	Dynamic definition of private subnets
	•	Dynamic configuration of DHCP per private subnet
	•	Static private address control for private subnets
	–	IPv6
	
== Basics ==
	•	Current Semantics
	–	Security Groups
	–	Private addressing for participating VMs
	–	Network level isolation of security groups
	–	Internet traffic ingress/egress firewalling
	–	Cross-group ingress/egress firewalling
	–	Dynamic reconfiguration of the above types of rules
	–	Elastic IPs
	•	Pending AWS semantics
	–	Security Groups
	•	VM participation in multiple security groups (membership vs. firewall groups)
	–	VPC
	•	Dynamic definition of private subnets
	•	Dynamic configuration of DHCP per private subnet
	•	Static private address control for private subnets
	–	IPv6

== VPC ==
	•	Overview
	–	Logically isolated environment 
	–	Your private IP range 
	–	Internet or Hardware VPN connectivity options 
	•	Capabilities
	–	User-defined address space up to /16
	–	Up to 20* user-defined, per AZ subnets up to /16
	–	User-defined:
	•	Virtual Routing, DHCP options, and NAT instances
	•	Internet Gateways, Private/Customer Gateways, and VPN tunnels
	–	Private IPs stable once assigned 
	–	Elastic Network Interfaces
		•	Enhanced Security Capabilities
	–	Network topology, routing, and subnet ACLs
	–	Security group enhancements
	•	Egress control
	•	dynamic (re)assignment
	•	richer protocol support
	–	Multiple network interfaces per instance 
	–	Completely private networking via VPN 
	–	Support for dedicated instances
	
=== Use Cases ===
	•	Mixing public and private resources
	–	E.g., web-facing hosts with DMZ subnets, control plane subnets
	•	Workloads that expect fixed IPs and/or multiple NICs
	•	AWS cloud as private extension of on- premises network
	–	Accessible from on-premises hosts
	–	No change to addressing
	–	No change to Internet threat/risk posture
	
=== Limits ===
	•	5 VPCs per Region
	•	20 Subnets per VPC
	•	10 Network ACLs per VPC 
	•	20 rules/ACL
	•	10 Route Tables per VPC 
	•	20 entries/Route Table
	•	50 Security Groups per VPC 
	•	50 rules/Security Group
	•	http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Appendix_Limits.html

=== Constraints ===
	•	Gateways require unique public IP addresses
	•	Non-overlapping IP Ranges w/ internal networks
	•	Inability to change CIDR/Subnet address ranges
	•	Can’t move instances from one subnet to another
	–	Relaunch for different VPC or AZ

* true edge networking
* turn node controller into the router
* split CC into CC and NS
* extensibility ==> SDN
* ipsets/ebtables  ==> ovs
* NC/edge networking ==> customer delight
* convolution w/ network architecture
* cloudstack virtual router situation
* even fewer network configuration dependencies to get full AWS functionality
* refactorization analysis
* what about public address routing
* ELB/multi-warlus implications
