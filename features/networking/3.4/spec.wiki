- Ensure we fix up STATICDYNMAC mode
- Introduce propagation of information about
-- addressing (DNS configuration)
-- elastic ips
-- l2 isolation
-- firewall rules
-- configuration of edge networking
- Network information document format
-+ multiple security groups per instances (*CLC and UI tasks*)
-+ VPC functionality
--+ subnet control
--+ private addresses
--+ ingress/egress rules
--+ control of gateways

1  Networking  Yes  A future plugins for SDNs, Cisco, Juniper, F5, etc.  Traffic_CC  --    all about design consideration                                  
1  Networking  Yes (AWS+)  A Being able to specify the default gateway (primarily for the infra admin. well understood. needs investigation)  Traffic_CC  MoreInfo    this is definition of edge                                  
1  Networking  Yes (AWS+)  A Provide simple, flexible choice based on customer's ability to control routing, addressing  Traffic_CC  MoreInfo    this is definition of edge                                  
1  Networking  Yes (AWS)  A Instances should be able to be part of multiple security groups (well understood. need investigation)  Traffic_CC  M    this should occur for only edge networking, and happen after                                  
3  networking  Yes (AWS)  A Ability to specify static IP assignment to instances (private IP stickiness) (Chris understands it. Difficult one. Chris needs to schedule somebody's time to look into the details involved in delivering feature before Engineering can provide more feedback)  AWS/Networking enhancements  unknown  edge networking  depends on edge networking
